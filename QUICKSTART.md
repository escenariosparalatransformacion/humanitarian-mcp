## First Use (5 Minutes)

### 1. Get the Guide
```
Use the humanitarian_negotiation_guide tool
```

This shows you all methodologies and how to use them.

### 2. Try Island of Agreement

Start a conversation with Claude:

```
I need to analyze a humanitarian negotiation using the Island of Agreement methodology.

Situation: [Describe your situation in 2-3 paragraphs]
My Organization: [Your org name]
Counterpart: [Their name]
```

Claude will use the `humanitarian_create_island_of_agreement` tool automatically.

### 3. Proceed to Iceberg Analysis

After reviewing your IoA results:

```
Now conduct an Iceberg and Common Shared Space analysis comparing us with [counterpart name].

Our positions: [List 3-5 demands]
Our reasoning: [Why these demands]
Our motives: [Deep values driving you]

Their positions: [What you know]
Their reasoning: [If known]
Their motives: [If known]
```

### 4. Map Stakeholders

```
Analyze the stakeholders in this negotiation:

[List each stakeholder with:
- Name and role
- Power (0-1): [estimate]
- Urgency (0-1): [estimate]  
- Legitimacy (0-1): [estimate]
- Position (-1 to 1): [estimate]
- Who they influence: [list names]
]
```

### 5. Target Influence

```
Develop influence tactics for [target stakeholder name] using the previous stakeholder analysis.
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Provide Rich Context
âœ“ Include numbers, locations, timeframes
âœ“ Describe constraints and challenges  
âœ“ Mention relevant history or precedents
âœ— Don't be vague or generic

### Be Specific About Stakeholders
âœ“ Use real names or clear titles
âœ“ Estimate attributes thoughtfully
âœ“ Map influence connections
âœ— Don't guess wildly at values

### Use Sequential Analysis
1. Start with Island of Agreement (foundation)
2. Then Iceberg Analysis (depth)
3. Then Stakeholder Analysis (engagement)
4. Then Influence Tactics (execution)

### Update Regularly
- Re-run analyses when situations change
- Update stakeholder positions as they shift
- Refine strategies based on outcomes

## Troubleshooting

### "Server not found" or "Connection error"
- Verify server is in Claude Desktop config
- Check the file path is correct
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Run `python humanitarian_negotiation_mcp.py` to check for errors

### "Invalid input" errors
- Check that all required fields are provided
- Verify numeric values are in correct ranges (0-1 for Power/Urgency/Legitimacy, -1 to 1 for Position)
- Ensure stakeholder names match exactly when using influence tool

### Poor quality outputs
- Provide more detailed context (200-500 words ideal)
- Be specific about positions, reasoning, motives
- Include relevant background and constraints
- Use concrete examples vs. generalities

### Server not appearing in Claude
- Run setup.py again to verify configuration
- Check Claude Desktop config file manually
- Ensure Python and dependencies are installed
- Look at Claude Desktop logs for errors

## Example Session Flow

```
User: I need help with a negotiation. We're trying to get access to IDP camps.

Claude: I can help you analyze this using humanitarian negotiation methodologies. 
Let me start by creating an Island of Agreement. Could you provide:

User: [Provides details]

Claude: [Uses humanitarian_create_island_of_agreement tool]
Here's your Island of Agreement analysis... [results]

Based on this, I recommend [strategic guidance]. Would you like me to:
1. Conduct an Iceberg analysis to understand deeper motivations?
2. Analyze stakeholders to map influence?
3. Both?

User: Let's do the Iceberg analysis

Claude: I'll need your positions, reasoning, and motives, plus what you know 
about the counterpart's...

[And so on...]
