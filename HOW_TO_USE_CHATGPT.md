# How to Use All Tools in ChatGPT - No Copy-Paste Needed!

## The New Way (RECOMMENDED) - Automatic Data Flow

Thanks to automatic caching, you **no longer need to copy-paste data** between tools!

### Simple 2-Step Workflow:

**Step 1: Analyze Stakeholders**
```
Analyze these stakeholders:
Context: [Your negotiation context]

Stakeholders:
1. Actor A - Power: 0.8, Urgency: 0.9, Legitimacy: 0.85, Position: 0.6
2. Actor B - Power: 0.7, Urgency: 0.8, Legitimacy: 0.9, Position: -0.7
3. Actor C - Power: 0.5, Urgency: 0.6, Legitimacy: 0.7, Position: 0.5
```

ChatGPT will return the analysis with all stakeholders and their priority levels.

**Step 2: Develop Influence Tactics (FOR EACH STAKEHOLDER)**
```
Now develop influence tactics for [Stakeholder Name] using the latest analysis.
```

That's it! The system automatically retrieves the analysis you just ran.

## Complete Example: Riverland Crisis

### Step 1: Run Stakeholder Analysis
```
Analyze these 5 stakeholders involved in the Riverland humanitarian crisis:

Context: Complex multi-party humanitarian response requiring coordination between government, armed groups, NGOs, donors, and media.

Stakeholders:
1. Riverland Government - Power: 0.9, Urgency: 0.8, Legitimacy: 0.95, Position: 0.6
2. GRN (Armed Group) - Power: 0.7, Urgency: 0.9, Legitimacy: 0.3, Position: -0.8
3. Local NGOs - Power: 0.5, Urgency: 0.8, Legitimacy: 0.7, Position: 0.7
4. Donors - Power: 0.6, Urgency: 0.7, Legitimacy: 0.8, Position: 0.8
5. Media - Power: 0.4, Urgency: 0.6, Legitimacy: 0.6, Position: 0.5
```

**Response:** Analysis with all 5 stakeholders, their salience scores, and priority levels (First/Second/Third).

### Step 2a: Develop Tactics for Riverland Government
```
Now develop influence tactics for Riverland Government using the latest analysis.
```

**Response:** Specific tactics for Riverland Government, including coalition opportunities (Donors + Local NGOs identified as allies).

### Step 2b: Develop Tactics for GRN (Armed Group)
```
Now develop influence tactics for GRN using the latest analysis.
```

**Response:** Different tactics for GRN, recognizing them as adversarial (position: -0.8).

### Step 2c: Develop Tactics for Other Actors
Repeat for Donors, Media, Local NGOs - just change the name!
